### DevOps Architect | Empowering Engineers to Compete Globally 🌍

I'm a Senior DevOps Engineer at Andela, where I architect enterprise-grade Azure infrastructure and Kubernetes deployments. Based in Abuja, Nigeria, I'm on a mission to help African engineers build world-class skills through [Teleios](https://jointeleios.com), a mentoring initiative I founded.
